### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In todayâ€™s world, pranks are running wild and unregulated. Innocent bystanders are getting jump-scared, glitter-bombed, and Rickrolled without a fighting chance. Society needs a defense mechanism â€” a way to prove youâ€™re worthy of being sparedâ€¦ preferably by striking a fabulous JoJo pose]

These Videos cover all the Useless fuctions of this website. One being the Main menu, how the mapping works in order to read the movements and correctly guess the pose and in the worst case of if you didn't do the project in time the system shuts down completely( The system only acts in shutting down but actually doesn't ).
